# Spam Mail Filtering

This is a personal project to evaluate different machine learning algorithms in their ability to classify if a provided email is a spam mail or not.

The application will provide text fields for inputs of single mail texts.

## Backend

The Backend makes use of the django framework from Python to implement APIs i.e. for the communication between the classifier and the displayed frontend.
